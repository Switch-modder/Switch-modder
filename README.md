## Hi there 👋
My name is Raj-jyot Singh Deol or u/Switch_modder or Switch-modder. I'm really into robots such as Anki's Vector robot. I'm currently working on a big project known as Victorware 2.0 as well as some other smaller projects. 
If you ever need to reach me my reddit account is u/Switch_modder. (Thanks to neohajin on discord for the profile picture)
